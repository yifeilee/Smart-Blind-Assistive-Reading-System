# Smart-Blind-Assistive-Reading-System

##Project Introduction

For this project, we designed it to solve the reading problem of blind people. Due to the advancement of AI text recognition and speech conversion technology, there are currently many devices on the market to convert e-books into speech for blind people to read, but due to the copyright of e-books, most of the books on the market have not been completed electronically, so the problem of how to use paper books for blind people to read still exists. And we use the gesture module, hope to offer a smooth user experience for them.

We have also designed a device for text output of tactile information for blind people, relying on a perfect Braille compilation system to complete the dynamic display of Braille.

Our system can be divided into image module, audio module, gesture recognition module and hardware module .
